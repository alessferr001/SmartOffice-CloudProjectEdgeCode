Project that developed an intelligent monitoring system for offices, using an Edge-to-Cloud IoT architecture. The system, based on Raspberry Pi, monitors environmental and behavioral parameters in real time and classifies human activities with a Machine Learning model (K-Nearest Neighbors). Data is sent to  the Cloud for storage and advanced analysis.
Key competences:
